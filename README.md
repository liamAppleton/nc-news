# NC News

## About this project

NC News is a react app built as the front-end for my back-end news api:
https://github.com/liamAppleton/nc-news-app

The design and functionality is based on the popular news site, Reddit. This is evidenced by the up/down voting system and general layout for articles and comments.

You can visit the app here: https://nc-hub.netlify.app/
